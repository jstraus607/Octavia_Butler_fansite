<div class="excerpts">

<h4>From "Positive Obsession," an autobiographical essay Butler wrote for <em>Essence</em> magazine, and which later appeared in <em>Bloodchild and Other Stories:</em>
</h4>
  <blockquote cite="https://bookshop.org/books/bloodchild-and-other-stories/9781583226988">
  "Obsession can be a useful tool if it's positive obsession. Using it is like aiming carefully in archery....I saw positive obsession as a way of aiming yourself, your life, at your chosen target."
</blockquote>

<h4>From an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KG68v0RGHsY" target="_blank">interview</a> in April 2000:
</h4>
<blockquote cite="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KG68v0RGHsY">
  "[Science fiction] is a matter of behaving as if the world were a little more the way you wish it were, in some way. So, my characters, who are often Black and Female behave as though they have no limitations. And they don't run around saying "I'm Black, I'm Female, I have no limitations!" They just behave this way, and do what they need to do."
</blockquote>

<h4>From "Furor Scribendi," also in <em>Bloodchild and Other Stories</em>:
</h4>
  <blockquote cite="https://bookshop.org/books/bloodchild-and-other-stories/9781583226988">
    <p>"Here are some potential impediments for you to forget about:
    </p>
  <p>First forget <em>inspiration.</em> Habit is more dependable. Habit will sustain you whether you're inspired or not. Habit will help you finish and polish your stories. Inspiration won't. Habit is persistence in practice.
  </p>
  <p>Forget <em>talent.</em> If you have it, fine. Use it. If you don't have it, it doesn't matter. As habit is more dependable than inspiration, continued learning is more dependable than talent. Never let pride or laziness prevent you from learning, improving your work, changing its direction when necessary."
  </p>

<h3>The Octavia Butler Papers</h3>
  <h4>A 2017 article,<a href="https://www.kcet.org/shows/artbound/break-in-case-of-emergency-octavia-e-butlers-legacy" target="_blank">"Break in Case of Emergency: Octavia Butler's Legacy"</a>,
   reflects on an archive exhibit of Octavia Butler's papers at the
   <a href="https://www.huntington.org/verso/2018/08/celebrating-octavia-butler" target="_blank">Huntington Library</a> in San Marino, California.
</h4>
   <blockquote cite="https://www.kcet.org/shows/artbound/break-in-case-of-emergency-octavia-e-butlers-legacy">
    <p>"Pilgrims to the archive can’t help but report it contains many an overburdened to-do list — get up, write, work, pay the bills, go shopping, see your mother, write, write, write, edit, believe. Rinse, repeat.
    </p>
 <p>A telling tick-tock of the effort it takes to just stay sane in a (real) world essentially bent to one’s erasure.
 </p>
 <p>A strain of magical thinking also ghosts the margins of these handwritten items....[paired with] Butler’s most radical resolution: to do what is right."
