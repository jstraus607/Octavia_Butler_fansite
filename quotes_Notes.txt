Found in a 2017 article <a href="https://www.kcet.org/shows/artbound/break-in-case-of-emergency-octavia-e-butlers-legacy" target="_blank">"Break in Case of Emergency: Octavia Butler's Legacy."</a> This article reflects on an archive exhibit of Octavia Butler's papers at the <a href="https://www.huntington.org/verso/2018/08/celebrating-octavia-butler" target="_blank">Huntington Library</a> in San Marino, California.

"[P]ilgrims to the archive can’t help but report it contains many an overburdened to-do list — get up, write, work, pay the bills, go shopping, see your mother, write, write, write, edit, believe. Rinse, repeat.

A telling tick-tock of the effort it takes to just stay sane in a (real) world essentially bent to one’s erasure.

A strain of magical thinking also ghosts the margins of these handwritten items....[as well as] Butler’s most radical resolution: to do what is right."



From "Positive Obsession," an autobiographical essay Butler wrote for <em>Essence</em> magazine, and which later appeared in <em>Bloodchild and Other Stories:</em>
"Obsession can be a useful tool if it's positive obsession. Using it is like aiming carefully in archery....I saw positive obsession as a way of aiming yourself, your life, at your chosen target."


	Positive obsession is about not being able to stop just because you're afraid and full of doubts. Positive obsession is dangerous. It's about not being able to stop at all.

	So, then, I write science fiction and fantasy for a living. As far as I know I'm still the only Black woman who does this.


Also from "Positive Obsession:"
"Still I am asked, what good is science fiction to Black people...
What good is science fiction's thinking about the present, the future, and the past? What good is its tendency to warn or to consider alternative ways of thinking and doing? What good is its examination of the possible effects of science and technology, or social organization and political direction?"


	From Butler's Afterword to "Positive Obsession"
I've often said that since my life was filled with reading, writing, and not much else, it was too dull to write about. I still feel that way...I have no doubt at all that the best and most interesting part of me is my fiction.

From an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KG68v0RGHsY" target="_blank">interview</a> in April 2000:
"It's a matter of behaving as if the world were a little more the way you wish it were, in some way. So, my characters, who are often Black and Female behave as though they have no limitations. And they don't run around saying "I'm Black, I'm Female, I have no limitations!" They just behave this way, and do what they need to do."

From "Furor Scribendi" in <em>Bloodchild and Other Stories</em>:
"Here are some potential impediments for you to forget about:

First forget <em>inspiration.</em> Habit is more dependable. Habit will sustain you whether you're inspired or not. Habit will help you finish and polish your stories. Inspiration won't. Habit is persistence in practice.

Forget <em>talent.</em> If you have it, fine. Use it. If you don't have it, it doesn't matter. As habit is more dependable than inspiration, continued learning is more dependable than talent. Never let pride or laziness prevent you from learning, improving your work, changing its direction when necessary."
