Following in the footsteps of Butler's use of science fiction to imagine solutions to real world problems, editors Walidah Imarisha and adrienne maree brown collected this anthology of stories inspired by contemporary social justice work:

"Whenever we envision a world without war, prisons, or capitalism, we are producing speculative fiction. Organizers and activists envision, and try to create, such worlds all the time. Walidah Imarisha and adrienne maree brown have brought 20 of them together in the first anthology of short stories to explore the connections between radical speculative fiction and movements for social change. These visionary tales span genres--sci-fi, fantasy, horror, magical realism--but all are united by an attempt to inject a healthy dose of imagination and innovation into our political practice and to try on new ways of understanding ourselves, the world around us, and all the selves and worlds that could be."

"We maintain a digital presence as a community to gather, share information, and talk about Octavia Butler, her legacy, and the things that we’re doing that reflect some of the principles in her writing." The network is most active through social media, but their <a href="http://octaviabutlerlegacy.com/" target="_blank">website</a> is <strong>very</strong> good.

Horror author and professor of Afrofuturism Tananarive Due credits Butler as the "Mother of Afrofuturism" in <a href="https://www.essence.com/entertainment/only-essence/octavia-butler-interview/" target="_blank"><em>Essence</em> Magazine</a>:
Afrofuturism—which spans literature, music, art and film—is Black artists’ proclamation of “I am, I was and I WILL BE,” straddling genres and styles to create Black art that imagines a world not quite our own. Afrofuturism is space travel, superheroes, sorcerers and seers. Afrofuturism is the audacity to imagine a thriving future for Black people, or any future.

 We both believe that Octavia, had she lived, might have been astonished at how many Black women speculative writers are thriving in her wake: N.K. Jemisin, Nnedi Okorafor, Nisi Shawl, Nalo Hopkinson, Tomi Adeyemi, Andrea Hairston, Ibi Zoboi, Chesya Burke, Jewelle Gomez, Karen Lord and more.
